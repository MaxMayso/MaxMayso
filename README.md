- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaxMayso 
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development, data science, machine learning, and automation engineering.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning automation engineering, that is because I am working as an automation engineer and learning new things everyday. I'm also in school
- full time to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science so generally everything in software engineering. On the weekends I like to take additional courses
- on web development and front-end development to learn new things, or spend time on Code Wars to sharpen my capabilities. My aspirations lay as being a CTO.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development, or freelance projects!
- 
- 📫 You can reach me at Mmlp.company@gmail.com
